## Introduction
With rapid development of E-business, the number of parcels delivered per day is 
exponentially increasing, which brings a great challenge to supply chain manager 
for an accurate forecasting in the daily operation management. The subject of this 
reasearch is concerned about the forecasting performance improvement in an E-business company.
The analytical method is time series analysis for a four-year dataset on the numeber of delivered parcels. 
With the time series analysis, I am goint to creat a predictive modelling by integrating serious factors 
such as tendancy, seasonality, holidays, commercial promotions, etc.

## Data

A four-year (2016-2020) dataset on the number of delivered parcels in a distribution center

## Approach
Data visualiation with Matplotlib in Python 
Simple linear regression for modelling the correlation between amount of turnovers and number of delivered parcels
ARIMA package for monthly time series modelling 
PROPHET package for daily time series modelling 
ANN machine learning for forecasting accuracy improvement 

## Queries that can be answered using given dataset
How about the tendancy, seasonality, holidays, commercial promotions of the given dataset?
What is the correlation ration between amount of turnovers and number of delivered parcels?
How is the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA modelling?
How is the forecasting accuracy of PROPHET modelling?
How is the forecasting accuracy of ANN modelling?
Is there an optimal solution to mix up proportionally all the forecasting results?

## Analysis
Required Libraries
ARIMA modelling for a monthly time series dataset with tendancy, seasonality and specific days. 
PROPHET modelling for a daily time series dataset with tendancy, seasonality and specific days.
ANN modelling for a machine learning application to improve overall accuracy
Solver optimization to mix up proportionally all the forecasting results
